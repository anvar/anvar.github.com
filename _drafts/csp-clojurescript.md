Client-side CSP with ClojureScript
----------------------------------

I have been looking for an excuse to play around with ClojureScript and core.async for a while now, and after reading [CSP is Responsive Design](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/31/extracting-processes/) I found my reason. In the article the author argues that programmers usually complect many different concerns when architecting user interface components. The article does a great job of explaining the ideas behind using Continous Sequential Processing (CSP) to separate areas of concern and promote a cleaner architecture, so I will not repeat it here, instead go back and read the article - it is worth it!
