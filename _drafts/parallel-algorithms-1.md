title: Parallel Algorithms, Part 1
category: posts
---


Due to the programming model that underpinns a GPU, special consideration needs to be taken when developing software in order to take advantage of the available parallelism. Optimized sequential algorithms often do not permit easy parallelisation and as such many operations that might be taken for granted in a CPU-world need to be re-implemented using parallel algorithms. Fortunately there is a number of algorithms specifically designed to take advantage of the vast number of cores that a GPU can offer.
