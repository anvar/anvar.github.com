title: "Exploration-Friendly Design"

I have been thinking a lot about UIs recently, and how some of them have a natural feel of exploration to them.

Siri

Take Siri as prime example. There is no manual, no instructions. Just a few phrases to get you started. Yet there are pages and pages out there dedicated solely to show off the functionality that people have been able to get out of Siri.

I think the approach Apple has taken here is a very interesting one. Instead of announcing everything Siri is capable of, which would have been a safe choice, they settled for just enough to get you started.

<div class="caption">Hello, Caption!</div>

The result, I think, is a deeper attachment. Because no one handed you the full set of commands, you had to look for them or play around until you stumbled upon something cool. The key here is that they gave enough to get you started, otherwise you might not have been inclined to start playing with it in the first place.

{% highlight cuda %}
__global__ 
void helloKernel(const float* const g_in, int* const g_out, const unsigned int n)
{
  unsigned int global_id = (blockIdx.x * blockDim.x) + threadIdx.x;

  if (global_id < n) {
    g_out[global_id] = g_in[global_id] * g_in[global_id];
  }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  const dim3 blockSize(128);
  const dim3 gridSize(256);

  const int number_of_elements = 10;
  int *h_in = new float[number_of_elements];

  int *d_in;
  checkCudaErrors(cudaMalloc(&d_in, 2 * sizeof(int) * number_of_elements));
  checkCudaErrors(cudaMemcpy(d_in,
                             h_in,
                             sizeof(int) * number_of_elements, 
                             cudaMemcpyHostToDevice));

  int *h_out = new float[number_of_elements];
  int *d_out;
  checkCudaErrors(cudaMalloc(&d_out, sizeof(int) * number_of_elements));

  helloKernel<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(d_in, d_out, number_of_elements);

  checkCudaErrors(cudaMemcpy(h_out,
                             d_out,
                             sizeof(int) * number_of_elements, 
                             cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost));

Finance UIs and Palantir
------------------------

The realm I work in happens to be finance, and the UIs we have are not primarily tailored to exploration. They are mostly for efficiency, and sometimes, for the feel of efficiency. By chance, though, I stumbled upon Palantir and their financial software, and felt that exploration sense tingling again. Concept-wise what they provide is very simple. They give you a funnel, where you can apply filters to the data in order to constrain it and spit back just the right subset. They also give you a text box, where you can type queries. And as you type your queries, they show an auto-complete menu, to help you out a bit. That is all you need, really! And I find it works extremely well. It makes me want to play with the data. Explore it. Pull it apart, and put it together differently.

(defn foo
  [bar]
  (baz bar))
{% endhighlight %}

Exploration-friendly design
---------------------------

I call it exploration-friendly design. And it works really, really well. All of a sudden I can make comparisons between equities as quickly as I can think of them. How does the revenue of MSFT correlate to the employee count of GOOG? How does LON:RYAs revenue follow the number of hours that their planes spent on the ground. All of these questions I never knew I need an answer for are now within my reach and it feels nothing less than magical. Yet no one else seems to be doing this, not even close. The standard seems to be to make me click through menus and make simple static comparisons for correlations I already know about. There is no exploration. At least not for me. So I form no bond with the software, nothing that keeps me lingering around. I go there just to do my business and and soon as it is done, I leave for something more interesting.
